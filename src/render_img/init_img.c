 * to know the size of the line in bytes to know by how many lines you need 
 * to hop by. Then let's say you are somewhere on that row in between
 * the begining and end of the line size. You would move by x bytes in 
 * the column space to get to your x coordinate. 
 * 
 * So this is how you translate coordinates on an x y plane on an image 
 * buffer :)
 * @param dst is the destination where you want to go in the 
 * image buffer.
 * @param pixel_offset is by how many pixels from the origin (img->addr) 
 * we have to move until we get to the exact yth row(or line of pixels)
 * and x pixels to the right. 
 * @struct t_my_image is needed to have the information about the 
 * image which is then used in our own put_pixel_to_image function
 * which is more precise than the mlx_put_pixel.
 * 
 * edge cases : if the offset you calculates is bigger than the 
 * buffer, then you are out of bounds.
